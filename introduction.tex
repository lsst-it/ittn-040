\section{Introduction}

The following documentation provides a closer look at the MTP/MPO fiber connections from the second floor to the camera that will be later installed in the mainframe of the telescope at Rubin Observatory while providing an inside look at the materials used and areas involved. The IT Team at Rubin is in charge of installing the MTP/MPO fiber optic cable that originates at the computer room located on the second floor of the main building and extends to the top of the TMA structure.

The main purpose of this cable is to obtain the data captured by the telescope camera. This data will be processed at Cerro Pachon Datacenter and sent to La Serena Datacenter for storage in which it will be sent to the US via the LHN main link.

 The cables used for this project were OM3/OM4 with 24 filaments MTP/MPO connectors with type A polarity. It is important to mention that both the OM3 and OM4 cables are fully compatible with each other. The specifications for this setup were provided by the National Accelerator Laboratory Group (SLAC).
