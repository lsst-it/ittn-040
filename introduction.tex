\section{Introduction}

The following documentation provides a closer look at the MTP/MPO fiber connections from the second floor to the camera that will be later installed in the mainframe of the telescope at Rubin Observatory while providing an inside look at the materials used and areas involved. The IT Team at Rubin is in charge of installing the MTP/MPO fiber optic cable that originates at the computer room located on the second floor of the main building and extending to the pier located on the sixth floor, any other connections related to this activity will be carried out by other Rubin Staff members.



The IT requirements are the following:

Install the 13 cables from the second floor to the sixth floor of the main building.
Separate 12 of those cables for the DAQ connections and use one of those cables for the CCS.


With this said, the IT group additionally will install 3 spare cables for future use if needed summing up to a total of 16 MTP/MPO cables for the camera. The cables used for this project were OM3/OM4 with 24 filaments MTP/MPO connectors with type A polarity. It is important to mention that both the OM3 and OM4 cables are fully compatible with each other. The specifications for this setup were provided by the National Accelerator Laboratory Group (SLAC).
